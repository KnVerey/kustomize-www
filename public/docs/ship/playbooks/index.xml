      <description>Kubernetes and Airgap  When distributing a Kubernetes (or Helm) application using Replicated Ship, there will be a running Kubernetes cluster to deploy to. Enterprise Kubernetes clusters that are used for internal applications can be installed and operated in airgapped environments. An airgap cluster is any cluster that doesn&amp;rsquo;t have outbound Internet access, and therefore cannot pull the application images from a Docker registry.
The recommended way to deploy applications to airgap clusters is to require a Docker registry that&amp;rsquo;s already running in the customer environment.</description>

      <description>Shipping a Docker Registry for airgap installations  Whgen distributing a Kubernetes (or Helm) application, most customers will be able to provide a Docker registry that required application images can be pushed to. Replicated Ship can retag and rewrite the Kubernetes YAML to work in this scenario.
If the Kubernetes cluster ] was set up using the Replicated Kubernetes installer, a Docker registry might not be available. The Replicated Kubernetes installer will pre-pull the registry:2 image on all nodes in the cluster.</description>
