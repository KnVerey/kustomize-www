      <description>Before a process should be enabled to automatically deploy the latest version of an application to a production server, it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to deploy each release to a different environment and run a series of tests to confirm the application is working as expected.
A common feature of most Ship applications is to include everything necessary to test the application, packaged as a bash script. This enables you, the operator, to rely on the operational knowledge that the software vendor has included to ensure each deployment and update is successful.</description>
