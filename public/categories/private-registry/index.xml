      <description>Replicated Private Registry Security  This document lists the security measures and processes in place to ensure that images pushed to the Replicated Private Registry remain private.
 Single Tenant Isolation  The registry is deployed and managed as a multi-tenant application, but each tenant is completely isolated from data created and pulled by other tenants. Docker images have shared base layers, but the Replicated Private Registry doesn&amp;rsquo;t share these between tenants.</description>
